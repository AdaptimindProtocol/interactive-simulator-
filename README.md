# Adaptimind Protocol: Interactive Simulator

This repository contains the source code for an interactive web-based simulator demonstrating the core principles of the **Adaptimind Protocol**.

## üöÄ What is Adaptimind?

Adaptimind is a next-generation Layer-1 blockchain architecture designed to solve the scalability trilemma through intelligent, on-demand resource allocation. Instead of forcing all transactions into a single, congested lane, our protocol's **AI-Oracle** dynamically creates isolated, high-performance environments ("dynamic shards") for resource-intensive applications.

This simulator visually demonstrates this core mechanic.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the Simulator

No installation is required. The simulator runs directly in any modern web browser.

1.  **Download the Code:** Click the green `<> Code` button at the top of this page and select `Download ZIP`.
2.  **Unzip the File:** Unpack the downloaded `interactive-simulator-main.zip` file.
3.  **Open in Browser:** Open the `index.html` file in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

Alternatively, you can use a service like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host it directly from this repository.

## üí° Core Principles Demonstrated

*   **Dynamic Shard Creation:** Watch how the system automatically creates a new, isolated shard when a "heavy" application (like a game) is launched.
*   **Network Stability:** Observe how the main network's performance (transactions per second, gas fees) remains stable and unaffected by the load on the dedicated shard.
*   **Resource Allocation:** See the visual representation of the AI-Oracle allocating resources and isolating traffic.
